>> Quick Summary for Adding Images and Links to Objects <<

When you attach an image to your object, or link to some other
outside resource like an HTML page, you must specify an internet
address (<URL>).  When specifying a URL, enclose it in double quotes
(e.g. "http://here.org/doc.html"). Omit the single quotes and angle
brackets used to delineate the examples below.

--To add an image to your object, use '@url <object> is <URL>'
--To determine the URL of an image on an object, use '@url for <object>'
--To add to your object some text that serves as a hyperlink to an
image or HTML document, use:
    @weblink <object> to <URL> (you'll be asked what the text should be)
--To add an image to an object, where the image is itself a hyperlink
to an image or HTML file, use:
    @url <object> is <URL of image to appear on the object>
then:
    @weblink <object> to <URL of file your object's image links to>
--To add an HTML document directly to your object, use '@url <object> is'
and don't specify a URL, or to use an editor, type '@url-edit <object>'
--To read an HTML document on an object, use '@url for <object>'
Note that the command '@url' has a synonym '@html'.
--To add an icon to your object, type '@icon <object> is <URL>'
--To determine the URL of an object's icon, use '@icon for <URL>'

@webcalls
  Usage:  @webcalls for <object>
          @webcalls
Reports approximately how many times an object has been viewed via
the web.  Omitting the object give just the total web calls for the
whole MOO since the BioWeb system was installed.

_______________________
Less useful and probably can be deleted:

@url-external
  Usage:  @url-ex <object> with <quoted text>
  This converts the already set URL for <object> to be external
instead of in-line on the person's web page, and uses <quoted text>
as the hyperlink that appears on the web browser's page.
