&nbsp; Moves you to the HTML Editor, allowing you to edit the HTML document
<BR>associated with an object. The HTML editor is mostly like the Note

</TABLE>
&nbsp; Shrinks or grows the object's VRML representation according to the
<BR>scaling specification. The cases of omitting the specification or
<BR>specifying zero have special meanings. Omitting the scaling
<BR>specifications returns the current scaling. Specifying a scaling of
<BR>zero resets the scaling to 1.0:1.0:1.0 (ie. the unmodified object
<BR>size).
<BR>&nbsp; Scaling specifications may be a single value, in which case
a
<BR>uniform scaling is implied (applied across the X, Y, and Z-axes).
<BR>For instance, "@scale dog is 200%" means increase the dog's size
<BR>two-fold. Two other ways of performing the same action with slightly
<BR>different commands are "@scale dog is 2x" and "@scale dog is 2" where
<BR>the latter implies "fold-scaling" and not percentage.
<BR>&nbsp; IMPORTANT! The scaling you specify is applied on top of the
<BR>current scaling setting. If the X-axis setting was already 2.0 and
<BR>you specify another 2.0 scaling, the result is a 4.0 X-axis scaling
<BR>value.
<BR>&nbsp; If you specify more than one number (either comma or space
<BR>delimited), they are applied as first X, then Y, then Z-axis
<BR>scalings. Omitting a value implies a scaling of 1 (ie. unchanged).
<BR>Using "@scale dog 2, ,4" is the same as "@scale dog 2,1,4" for
<BR>instance.

&nbsp; Allows you to set or read various settings associated with the VRML

<BR>specifically associated with a particular class of object.
<BR>&nbsp; If you omit the &lt;setting name> you'll be presented with a
list of
<BR>all the VRML settings on the object and their current values. If you
<BR>specify a VRML setting by name you'll be prompted for the new value
<BR>of that setting.
<BR>&nbsp; To change the value of a VRML setting, just repeat the command
and
<BR>enter the new value when prompted. To remove a setting from the list
<BR>associated with the object, just enter an empty line for the value
<BR>and you'll be asked if you want to clear it (say yes).

<P>lights
<BR>&nbsp; The text for the room's lights, normally retrieved from
<BR>$vrml_utils.std_roomlights, can be overridden with this web setting.
<BR>This is only valid for a room.

<P>linkzone
<BR>&nbsp; The place where various link objects that go in every room should
<BR>appear (ie. the "link to web" object) can be overridden with this
<BR>VRML setting. The $vrml_utils.std_linkzone property has the default
<BR>value. This is only valid for a room.

</TABLE>
&nbsp; Allows you to set or read various settings associated with the web
<BR>properties of an object. These may be MOO-wide properties or ones
<BR>specifically associated with a particular class of object.
<BR>&nbsp; If you omit the &lt;setting name> you'll be presented with a
list of

<BR>&nbsp; To change the value of a web setting, just repeat the command

<BR>and you'll be asked if you want to clear it (say yes).

<P>MOO-wide Web Settings:

<P>bodytag_attributes
<BR>&nbsp; The attributes text of the &lt;BODY> tag, used to set the background
<BR>and text colors for the web page associated with an object. Note that
<BR>objects take on the web background properties of the room they're in
<BR>unless they have their own bodytag_attributes setting. An example:
<BR>&nbsp; BGCOLOR="#D0D0D0" BACKGROUND="http://node.edu/images/sample.gif"

<P>hide_banner
<BR>&nbsp; Supresses the MOO's banner within the web page generated for
the
<BR>object. Any non-empty value for "hide_banner" will work.

<P>preformatted
<BR>&nbsp; If this web setting is present and not empty, it indicates the
<BR>entire HTML document associated with the object should be surrounded
<BR>by &lt;PRE> ... &lt;/PRE> tags, and therefore displayed in a
<BR>non-proportional font.

</TR>
</TABLE>
&nbsp; These let you read or set the associated URL link, in-MOO HTML
<BR>document, or VRML description associated with an object. The "for"
<BR>forms show you the current value, while the "is" forms let you set
a
<BR>new value. The @vrml command only has a "for" form, and you should
<BR>use @vrmledit to set an object's VRML description. Note that the URL
<BR>specified in the "@url" command should be enclosed in double quotes.
<BR>&nbsp; Objects may have either a URL associated with them (generally
<BR>pointing to either an image or an web page outside the MOO) or can
<BR>have the text of an HTML document. They cannot have both, but this
<BR>is not a limitation since you can associate an HTML document with an
<BR>object and that can have as many links to images or outside web pages
<BR>that you wish. Note that the format for entering an HTML document
<BR>will cause you to be prompted for lines of that document.
<BR>&nbsp;IMPORTANT: The @vrml command will give you a room's interior
VRML
<BR>description if you're in the room at the time, else its exterior VRML
<BR>description.

<TD VALIGN=TOP>@weblink &lt;object> to &lt;URL></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
&nbsp; Used to associate an outside web page with the specified object.
<BR>If the object already has a URL with a string value (presumably
<BR>the address of an in-line image, like a GIF format file), it assumes
<BR>you wish that image to serve as the hyperlink to &lt;URL>.
<BR>&nbsp; If the URL is a list (an HTML document), it warns you and asks
if
<BR>you want to clear it and enter some text to serve as the hyperlink.
<BR>If no URL is set on the object, it asks for the text you wish to
<BR>serve as a hyperlink to &lt;URL>.
<BR>&nbsp; This command actually constructs a small HTML document (generally
<BR>one or two lines) and attaches it to the object. It uses the
<BR>information already associated with the object as described above to
<BR>determine what sort of HTML document to construct.

<TD VALIGN=TOP>@webpass&nbsp;
<BR>@webpass &lt;password></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
&nbsp; This command is used to obtain a random web password (the first
<BR>syntax), or to set your stable web password (the second). The
<BR>webpass can be used when connecting via a web broswer to the MOO's
<BR>web system. If your browser does not support the more secure "web
<BR>authentication system," or the MOO isn't configured as an HTTP/1.0
<BR>server you can use the web pass system instead.

<P>&nbsp; To open a web window using a webpass:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. First establish a Telnet connection to the MOO,
as usual.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. If you have not set a webpass already, you can
do so by typing
<BR>"@webpass &lt;password>" where &lt;password> is NOT your usual connection
<BR>password. If you don't want to set a stable webpass, you can type
<BR>"@webpass" to be given a temporary webpass.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Point your web browser to the MOO's web gateway
page and enter
<BR>your webpass into the search field on that page.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Depending on the MOO's settings, you may get
the
<BR>web-applications menu, and you probably want to select "The Standard
<BR>Viewer" to open a web window into the MOO. If you don't get the
<BR>application list, you will probably be directly connected to the
<BR>Standard Web Viewer.
<BR>&nbsp; The webpass system offers all the same features as the
<BR>web authentication system, but as the latter is more secure, we
<BR>recommend that if your browser and the MOO supports it.
