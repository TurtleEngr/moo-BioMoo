  Introductory Guide to the BioGate System
</H1>
<P>
Welcome to the BioGate system, a web interface for MOOs. This document will
give you some quick introductory information on using the BioGate system.
Detailed instructions for connecting to the MOO's web system will be found
on the MOO's Web Gateway page. There is a section below, however, on "What
to do if you can't seem to connect to the MOO's web system." If you are
unfamiliar with MOOs in general, other information is available elsewhere
on that subject.

<P>
The BioGate system is a set of MOO objects and associated MOO modifications
that allow the MOO to function as a web server. In addition, some of the
objects provided are "viewers" that allow you to see into the MOO via web
pages, much like how the common telnet/client interface gives you a text
window into the virtual world that is the MOO. The key is that MOOs are not,
as is often said, text-based virtual reality (VR). It is simply that the
only means users had for perceiving their VR world was text. The BioGate system
provides the tools for both adding multimedia information to MOO objects,
and for allowing users to perceive those objects and their extended associated
characteristics.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="Howtolook"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I use the BioGate system to look
around the VR world?</FONT></A>
<P>
The usual way to get a multimedia window into the MOO is by connecting with
your own web browser to the Standard Viewer, supplied with the BioGate package.
It is called "standard" because there is nothing to prevent administrators
or users from making their own custom viewers, and facilities are provided
in the BioGate system for allowing users to specify what their default viewer
will be. The Standard Viewer is typically the user's default viewer when
they connect unless they've changed it.
<P>
One uses the Standard Viewer by first opening an ordinary telnet/client
connection to the MOO, and then opening a web window via the MOO's Web Gateway
page (that page has detailed instructions on how to do this). You will usually
then get a web page produced by the Standard Viewer. There are two major
reasons to have a text-only window in addition to the multimedia window (the
minor reason is that the Standard Viewer won't let you use it unless you
have a text connection open too). First, the text-only window is real time,
and provides the best system for live conversations with other MOO users.
To use the MOO as simply a provider of web pages is a waste of one of this
VR system's greatest strengths: live communication. Second, limitations in
the current MOO servers make it difficult to automatically add web manipulation
features to all MOO objects, and instead, such object manipulation must be
custom designed for each object class. This is expected to be solved by the
release of the LambdaMOO server version 1.8.0 sometime in the (hopefully
near) future. Until then, most object manipulation is best performed via
the telnet window.
<P>
Using a viewer to see into the VR world and move around is as simple as any
other web application: select the hyperlinks you see on the page. Some of
these are exits and will move you to a new room. When that happens, you'll
see confirmation of the movement in your text-only window. Other hyperlinks
are the names of objects, and selecting those will typically lead to a
description of the object plus any additional multimedia information associated
with the object. Finally, some links are "administrative" and allow you to
customize your web page, your character, or other objects you own. Some of
these lead to new pages with forms to fill out, and others act immediately.
The best way to find out what the different links do is to try them. Also,
it's rather fun.
<P>
Notice that although the text-only window is updated when you move through
the MOO using the web window, the web window remains unchanged if you move
using the text-only window. This is because web pages are obtained by opening
a connection to the MOO, getting the page, and closing that connection. Once
the page is retrieved, your web browser and the MOO are not communicating
(there are exceptions, but this is an introduction). The simplest way to
update your web window if you've moved using the telnet/client window is
to select one of the "Look around" links on the web page. That will cause
the browser to retrieve an updated view of where you are. Note that if you
have selected some object in the web window and are looking at it, you can
restore the page to the room's description again by selecting a "Look around"
link.
<P>
You'll notice that the Standard Viewer presents its web page in a consistent
format. The top of the page has the banner (if any), and possibly a link
to the web applications list (users can customize their display so this is
on the bottom). Below that is the "button bar" which has a set of shortcuts
for performing various functions, including teleporting to important rooms,
customizing the web page, and other features. Underneath that you'll find
selectable maps, allowing you to quickly teleport around the MOO (unless
you've turned them off).
<P>
The next major section is the "what's here" part. You'll see a list of what
objects are in the room with you, a list of what you're carrying (optionally),
and list of what exits lead from the room (which optionally include the name
of the destination). Under the "what's here" section is the "focus area."
This is the part of the page where you see the thing that you're currently
looking at. When you first enter a room, it will generally show the rooms
name and description. Note that just to the left of the name is a link to
the top of the page. When you select an object in the room (from the "what's
here" section), you'll get a new page with the description of that object
in the focus area replacing that of the room.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="Standardvsghost"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is the difference between the
Standard Viewer and the Ghost Viewer?</FONT></A>
<P>
Most of the time, you'll want to use the Standard Viewer to see into the
MOO. Some people, though, can't open both a telnet/client connection and
a web connection at the same time. Other people want to see into the MOO,
but don't need or want to talk with people or manipulate objects. Note that
you don't need to have a registered character to use the Standard Viewer,
though, since guests can get a temporary web password to use when opening
a web window (as described on the MOO's Web Gateway page).
<P>
The Ghost Viewer allow uses to see into the MOO without opening a telnet/client
connection. This is mostly useful for three main situations. One is when
you want people to see your multimedia MOO creations but not have to connect
via telnet or learn to use the MOO's text interface. You can just give them
the URL of the room or object you want them to see in the form:
http://bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il:8000/99anon/anonview/4715 where "4715" is the
object number of the room or object. Note that you can obtain a MOO object's
number by using "examine &lt;object&gt;" and finding it in the list of aliases.
A URL in the above format will take you directly to the Ghost Viewer, with
the specified object as its focus.
<P>
Another use of the Ghost Viewer is to just peek into the MOO via web when
you want a quick look at something, but don't want to bother making the extra
telnet/client connection. If you use the same URL format as given above,
but leave off the object number, you'll go to the "ghost's home" room in
the MOO and from there can make your way to where you need to go.
<P>
Finally, you can use the Ghost Viewer, when you already have a web window
open, to get a quick look at some other room in the MOO. Just open a second
web browser window, and in THAT window go to the Ghost Viewer address. When
you move your ghost in that window, your character will stay in place. You
can throw off as many of these astral projections as you wish, and wander
the MOO with them.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="Manipulation"><FONT SIZE=+1> Can I manipulate objects through the
web?</FONT></A>
<P>
Although most objects won't be manipulable through the web, some certainly
are. The most common examples are notes and letters. When you select these,
you'll see the object's description, and then an additional section marked
"Actions" with one action available: read. The "read" command is a hyperlink,
so you can select it and the text of the note will replace the note's description
in the focus area.
<P>
If a programmer has added support for web-awareness to the object, you may
find far more sophisticated controls in the focus area when you select an
object. The BioGate system provides facilities for programmers to add hyperlinks
or even full web forms to their objects. When you select the link or use
the form, the relevant information gets sent to the object and handled in
whatever way the programmer has arranged. This can lead to a new set of
information in the text area, or even cause things to happen in the MOO itself,
such as making you teleport to a new place.
<P>
Future versions of the MOO server are expected to include features making
it possible to automatically present all object commands via the web window.
Programmers will still be able to customize the web-aware features of their
objects, but will not be required to do so to enable users to manipulate
the objects via the web.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="Imagesandsound"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I add images and sounds to
my own objects?</FONT></A>
<P>
A separate document entitled "The Builder's Guide to the BioGate System" is
available that details how MOO builders can associate multimedia information
with their objects. Note that only "builders" in the technical sense (MOO
users whom the administrators have given builder privileges) can use these
features. Builders can add icons, pictures, sounds or entire HTML documents
to any of the MOO objects they've created. In addition, some specially programmed
objects may have additional capabilities depending on their web-aware aspects.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="Webaware"><FONT SIZE=+1> How can I program objects to be
web-aware?</FONT></A>
<P>
A separate document entitled "The Programmer's Guide to the BioGate System"
is available, which details the relevant aspects of the BioGate system for
programmers. This guide enables MOO programmers to add new functionality
and special web aware features to their objects. In addition, using the web
allows programmers to make web interfaces for their objects that can greatly
simplify their set-up or use by combining what would be several separate
text commands into a single web page.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="Failconnect"><FONT SIZE=+1>What should I do if I can't seem to connect
to the web system at all?</FONT></A>
<P>
We're still collecting information on the various circumstances when people
have trouble connecting to the MOO's web system. If you don't find an answer
in this section, please feel free to post questions to the appropriate
mail-folder in the MOO, or send a letter to the person or people maintaining
the BioGate system at the MOO.
<P>
Some hints:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Don't put spaces in either your user name or your web password when you set
    them (either upon connecting or by the @webpass command).
  <LI>
    Make sure you have the latest version of the web browser you're using (there's
    a web page for testing if your browser is the latest release). Although we
    cannot support every browser, a strong effort has been made to support the
    most common ones. In addition, the BioGate system is routinely tested with
    the latest Netscape Navigator and NCSA Mosaic versions for Mac and PC.
    Non-graphical browsers such as Lynx are not likely to be supported in the
    near future.
